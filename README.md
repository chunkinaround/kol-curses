# kol-curses
Library for various ways to interact with other players in kol. In this script you will ash implementations for using a lot of the "curse" items in kol (referred to here as items that you use on other players and named such because they mostly use curse.php)

# How to install
`svn checkout https://github.com/chunkinaround/kol-curses/branches/master/KoLmafia`

# Usage
This script does nothing for itself, rather its a library you can import into other ash scripts so you can do things such as send candy hearts with messages or use flavored foot oil on someone if you have them in your inventory. Just include a `import <ncurses.ash>` at the top of your scripts. Anyway here are the functions provided within:
